# AI control of tokamak fusion reactor
- KSTAR is a tokamak (donut-shaped nuclear fusion device) located in South Korea.
- This repository provides an AI that designs the tokamak operation trajectory to control the fusion plasma in KSTAR.
- Here, we would like to control 3 physics parameters; Î²p, q95 and li.
- I recommend you to see [the tokamak simulator](https://github.com/jaem-seo/KSTAR_tokamak_simulator) first.

# Installation
- You can install by
```
$ git clone https://github.com/jaem-seo/AI_tokamak_control.git
$ cd AI_tokamak_control
```

# 1. Target arrival for 4 s interval
- Open the GUI. It takes a bit depending on your environment.
```
$ python ai_control_v0.py
```
or
```
$ python ai_control_v1.py
```

</p>

- Slide the toggles in the right side to change the target state and press the "AI control" button (it takes a bit).
- Then, the AI will design the tokamak operation trajectory to achieve the target you set.

# 2. Real-time target tracking
- Open the GUI. It takes a bit depending on your environment.
```
$ python rt_control_v0.py
```
or
```
$ python rt_control_v1.py
```

</p>

- Slide the toggles in the right side to change the target state.
- Then, the AI will adjust the tokamak operation to track the targets in real-time.

# Note
- The AI was trained by reinforcement learning; [TD3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09477), [HER](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01495) implementation from [Stable Baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines).
- The tokamak simulation and the plotting possess most of the computation time, and the AI operation control is very fast.
- Deployment on the KSTAR PCS control system will require further development.
